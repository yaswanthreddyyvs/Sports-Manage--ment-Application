    <h1>Cricket Overview</h1>

    <h2>Formats:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Test Cricket:</strong> The longest format, played over five days.</li>
        <li><strong>One Day Internationals (ODIs):</strong> Limited to 50 overs per side.</li>
        <li><strong>Twenty20 (T20):</strong> The shortest format with each team facing 20 overs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Playing Field:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cricket field is typically circular with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch at the center.</li>
        <li>The pitch has two sets of three stumps each, and a batsman from one team faces deliveries bowled by a player from the opposing team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Players:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cricket team consists of batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders.</li>
        <li>Batsmen aim to score runs, while bowlers try to dismiss batsmen and limit their scoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Runs:</strong> Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the stumps. Boundaries (four runs) and sixes (six runs) are scored by hitting the ball beyond the playing field.</li>
        <li><strong>Wickets:</strong> The primary aim of the bowling team is to take wickets. A wicket falls when the stumps are disturbed by the bowler, or a catch is taken by the fielding side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>International Cricket:</h2>

        <li><strong>Teams:</strong> Cricket is played at the international level, with teams representing their countries. Notable teams include India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies.</li>

    <h2>Evolution of the Game:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The introduction of technologies like DRS (Decision Review System) has added a layer of precision to decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>T20 Leagues:</strong> The rise of T20 leagues, such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), has brought a new dimension to the sport, attracting global talent and a massive fan following.</li>
