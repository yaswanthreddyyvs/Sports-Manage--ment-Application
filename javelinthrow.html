    <h1>Javelin Throw Overview</h1>

    <h2>Basics of Javelin Throw:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The javelin is a spear-like implement made of metal and fiberglass.</li>
                <li>It typically measures around 2.6 to 2.7 meters in length and weighs 600 grams for men and 800 grams for women.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Technique:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Javelin throwers use a run-up to build momentum before releasing the javelin.</li>
                <li>The throw involves a combination of speed, strength, and technique.</li>
                <li>Athletes aim to throw the javelin at an angle that maximizes distance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Runway and Sector:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The event takes place on a rectangular field with a runway and a throwing area.</li>
                <li>The throwing area is divided into sectors, and a throw is measured from the point where the javelin lands to the nearest edge of the sector.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules and Scoring:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Foul Throws:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A throw is considered a foul if the athlete steps over the foul line at the end of the runway or if the javelin lands outside the sector boundaries.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Measurement:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The distance is measured from the landing point to the nearest edge of the sector, not from the point where the javelin first makes contact with the ground.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Three Attempts:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Each athlete typically gets three attempts in the qualifying round, with the top performers advancing to the final.</li>
                <li>In the final, athletes usually get three additional attempts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Javelin Throw Technique:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Approach:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Athletes use a run-up, accelerating to generate maximum speed.</li>
                <li>The approach involves a specific number of steps, with the athlete transitioning into the throwing phase.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Grip and Release:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The javelin is held at the grip, and the athlete aims to release it at the optimal angle for distance.</li>
                <li>The release is a critical aspect, and the javelin should be thrown with a smooth and controlled motion.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flight and Landing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A well-thrown javelin exhibits a combination of speed, spin, and trajectory for maximum distance.</li>
                <li>The javelin should land within the sector boundaries for a valid throw.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
